# projectMoments_RN
## My First ever completed personal programming project. 
Checkout at branch develop/feature to see the project before it got redesigned. 
<br />
Checkout at branch Veoo1607 to see the final(it's doable for now) product and the new redesigned UI. 
<br />
I got to play around with a lot of React Native common and uncommon concepts:
- React Native components
- Styling and layout 
- Making a progress bar
- Redux 
- Animation with Lottie 
- Swipe carousel 
- Moment.js
## Lesson learned:
Always do prototyping before coding, I wasted a dozen hours just because I constantly change the UI design. 
## The idea is to have an application to save the memorable moments, and the carousel list is the timeline (and yes this is a gift to my gf).
There are two simple functions:
- [X] Quick camera snap 
- [X] Horizontal carousel of picture and ordered by dates
