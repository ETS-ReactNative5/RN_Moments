# projectMoments_RN
## My First ever completed personal programming project. 
Checkout at branch develop/feature to see the project before it got redesigned. <br />
Checkout at branch Veoo1607 to see the final(it's doable for now) product and the new redesigned UI. <br />

I got to play around with a lot of React Native common and uncommon concepts:
- React Native components
- Styling and layout 
- Making a progress bar
- Redux 
- Animation with Lottie 
- Swipe carousel 
- Moment.js
## The idea is to have an application to save the memorable moments, and the carousel list is the timeline.
There are two simple functions:
- [X] Quick camera snap 
- [X] Horizontal carousel of picture and ordered by dates
